      <h2>About Allison</h2>
      <p><strong>Softball Number: #10</strong></p>
      <p>Allison is a dedicated softball pitcher who absolutely loves the game. Her favorite sport is softball, and she enjoys hitting with her DeMarini bat. In addition to pitching, Allison also plays third base and brings energy to every practice and game.</p>
      <p>She loves sliding, stealing bases, and making diving plays. Allison has many friends on her team and values bonding with them both on and off the field. Her dad has coached many of her teams when she was younger, and her mom, dad, and dog never miss a single game.</p>
      <p>Outside of softball, Allison plays three sports in total but dedicates most of her time to pitching practice almost every day. Her commitment and love for the sport make her an amazing athlete and teammate.</p>
